      <p class="policy-intro">
        ANU Hospitality Staff LTD is committed to a policy of ethical trading in the provision of its services and as an employer. Freedom of opportunity in employment and the right to collective bargaining, or to join or form a trade union, is available for all sections of our workforce.
      </p>

      <p class="policy-text">
        In an organisation like ours, where our clients control our workforce, we are committed to ensuring a safe and healthy working environment for all our temporary workers. We work closely with our clients to prevent accidents and dangerous occurrences, ensuring workers are aware of hazards through risk assessments and training.
      </p>

      <p class="policy-text">
        All workers are supplied with written terms and conditions. We ensure that our workers are paid at or above the national minimum wage, and that hours worked comply with the Working Time Directive. Payslips are provided for each pay period detailing hourly rates, hours worked, and deductions for income tax and National Insurance contributions. No other deductions are made without workers’ consent.
      </p>

      <p class="policy-text">
        There is no discrimination in hiring, wages, hours of work, compensation, access to training, promotion, termination, or retirement based on race, colour, ethnic or national origin, religion, age, gender, disability, marital status, sexual orientation, union membership, or political affiliation. There is no physical abuse, threat of physical abuse, sexual or other harassment, verbal abuse, or any other form of intimidatory action.
      </p>

      <p class="policy-text">
        If a worker has a grievance or cause to complain, the correct procedure is to call our Head Office on <strong>020 8965 1575</strong> and ask to speak to the Senior Manager, giving full details of the complaint.
      </p>

      <p class="policy-text">
        The standards detailed above are our minimum standards, and we aim to exceed these standards whenever and wherever possible.
      </p>
