      <p class="policy-intro">
        Modern slavery is a crime and a violation of fundamental human rights. It takes various forms such as slavery, servitude, forced and compulsory labour, and human trafficking, all of which share the common factor of depriving a personâ€™s liberty for personal or commercial gain.
      </p>

      <p class="policy-text">
        ANU Hospitality Staff LTD operates as an employment business and is fully aware of the risks involved in the supply of temporary labour. We are committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships, implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to ensure slavery and human trafficking do not take place anywhere in our workforce. We also expect the same commitment from our supply chains.
      </p>

      <p class="policy-text">
        As part of this commitment, we constantly review our workplace policies and procedures to assess their effectiveness in identifying and tackling any modern slavery issues. We operate a robust recruitment policy, including conducting eligibility to work checks for all employees to safeguard against human trafficking or individuals being forced to work against their will.
      </p>

      <p class="policy-text">
        We regularly conduct staff training so that employees understand the signs of modern slavery and know how to respond if they suspect it is taking place within our organisation or supply chain.
      </p>

      <p class="policy-text">
        Our systems are in place to:
      </p>
      <ul class="policy-list">
        <li>Identify and assess potential risk areas in our workforce.</li>
        <li>Mitigate the risk of slavery and human trafficking in our workforce.</li>
        <li>Work with our supply chains to identify and assess potential risk areas.</li>
        <li>Mitigate the risk of slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains.</li>
        <li>Protect whistleblowers.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="policy-text">
        We have zero tolerance towards slavery and human trafficking. To ensure a high level of understanding of the risks, training provided to staff is ongoing. We also require our business partners to provide similar training to their employees and suppliers to mitigate potential risks.
